# About the game

This game is a trainig project. The purpose  was to accomplish a "large" project in python (by large I mean multiple files and more than a thousand lines of code).  
A second purpose was to sharp my comprehesion of inheritance. The best example is the AnimatedSprite class which inherits from the inbuilt Sprite class. Then the Player and the Mob classes inherit from it.
I am a single learner, so I'm aware that what i've done is certenly not the best practice. Any code review is very welcomed.

# Requirements
The game has been developed using python 3.10 and pygame 2
